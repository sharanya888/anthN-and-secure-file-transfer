A salt. Randomizes the KDFâ€™s output. Optional, but highly recommended. Ideally as many bits of entropy as the security level of the hash: often that means cryptographically random and as long as the hash output. Worse (shorter, less entropy) salt values can still meaningfully contribute to security. May be reused. Does not have to be secret, but may cause stronger security guarantees if secret; see RFC 5869 and the HKDF paper for more details. If None is explicitly passed a default salt of algorithm.digest_size // 8 null bytes will be used.
